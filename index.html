         My name is Alexandria Weathersby, A Business graduate from Missouri Baptist University. I am currently in the field of Social Services working with urban youth. I have become interested in coding over a duration of time. My first experience with coding was back in
        2014, where I attended a Hackathon event at UMSL. During this event we learned the basics of coding and even built an app from the
        ground up.Currently I am enrolled in the Coder Girl Winter Cohert 2017 working on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
