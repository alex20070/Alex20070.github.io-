         My Name is Alexandria Weathersby, A Business Graduate from Missouri Baptist University. I am currently in the field of Social Services<br> 
        working with urban youth. I have become interested in coding over a duration of time. My first experience with coding was back in<br>
        2014 where I attended a hackathon event at UMSL. During this event we learned the basics of coding and even built a app from the<br>
        ground up.<br> Currently I am enrolled in the Coder Girl Winter Cohert 2017 working on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
